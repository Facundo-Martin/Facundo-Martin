<h1 align="center">👋 Hi there</h3> 

Glad you found your way here! I'm Facundo, a Software Engineer who's passionate about crafting systems where code is just the implementation detail. I build from zero-to-one with a focus on clean interfaces and thoughtful architecture that compounds value over time. You can read more about me [here](https://facundomartin.dev/about)

Most recently, I was at Til where I helped scale their guitar lessons marketplace as their 3rd engineer. I navigated the journey from seed stage through critical technical inflection points—building search experiences, scheduling systems, and finding that balance between rapid innovation and sustainable engineering.

What drives me isn't just writing code, but designing patterns that make each new feature easier to build than the last. I'm drawn to that sweet spot where craftsmanship doesn't have to be sacrificed for speed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I primarily work with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, paired with whatever ORM and serverless combo allows me to prototype quickly and build fast.

Lately, I've been exploring **edge computing** and am particularly intrigued by what **Turso** is doing for global data distribution. I'm always curious about technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

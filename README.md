## üëã Hello

<!-- <p align="center">

Glad to see you here! I'm Facundo, a **Software Engineer** with a passion for building **clean interfaces** and **thoughtful architecture**. I love creating robust systems that help startups thrive and find satisfaction in elegant solutions to complex problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring architecture patterns, reading tech blogs, or experimenting with new frameworks.

Most recently, I was at **Til**, a marketplace for guitar lessons, where I joined as the 3rd engineer. I helped scale the platform from seed stage through various technical challenges, building everything from search experiences to payment systems. My approach blends practical engineering with forward-thinking architecture that evolves with product needs. I'm particularly drawn to technologies that maximize developer productivity while solving real business problems.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical Writing

I write in-depth articles about software engineering, focusing on practical lessons and architecture decisions:

- [2 Years Building TIL: Engineering Lessons & Hard-Won Insights](https://facundomartin.dev/articles/two-years-building-til-engineering-lessons-and-hard-won-insights) 
- [Building a Lightning-Fast Search Experience](https://facundomartin.dev/articles/building-a-lightning-fast-search-experience-mistakes-breakthroughs-and-performance-wins)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

I primarily work with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, paired with whatever ORM and serverless combo allows me to prototype quickly and build fast. I'm a full-stack engineer who thrives on owning features end-to-end, from zero to one.

Lately, I've been exploring **edge computing** and am particularly intrigued by what **Turso** is doing for global data distribution. I'm always curious about technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

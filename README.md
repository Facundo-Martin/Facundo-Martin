## About Me

I'm Facundo. I build software with an emphasis on clean interfaces and thoughtful architecture. Passionate about engineering robust systems that help startups thrive. I tend to own features end-to-end, from planning to deployment, and enjoy bridging the gap between design, engineering, and user experience.
